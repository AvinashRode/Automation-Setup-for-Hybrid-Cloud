# Automation setup for FASCON 

Automation tools can streamline the setup, deployment, management, and monitoring of your hybrid system.

## Documentation

Automation tools into the process:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use tools like Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform to define and deploy your Azure infrastructure in a declarative manner. This ensures consistency and repeatability in your deployments.

2. **Configuration Management**: Tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef can help automate the configuration of your on-premises servers and Azure resources. You can define the desired state of your systems and let these tools enforce that state automatically.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Azure DevOps, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of your applications and configurations to both on-premises and Azure environments.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting Automation**: Set up automated monitoring and alerting using tools like Azure Monitor, Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack. Define thresholds and conditions for alerts, and automate responses to common issues.

5. **Backup and Disaster Recovery Automation**: Use tools provided by Azure, such as Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery, to automate the backup and replication of your data and applications between on-premises and Azure environments.

6. **Scaling and Auto-Scaling**: Utilize Azure Auto Scaling capabilities to automatically adjust the capacity of your Azure resources based on demand. You can also use automation scripts to scale resources on-premises if needed.

7. **Security Automation**: Implement automated security checks and remediation using tools like Azure Security Center, Azure Policy, or third-party solutions. Automate the enforcement of security policies and the detection and response to security threats.

8. **Testing Automation**: Automate testing processes such as integration testing, performance testing, and security testing using tools like Selenium, JMeter, or OWASP ZAP. Integrate these tests into your CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.


## Deployment


The implementation of automation tools and processes can span both your Azure cloud environment and your on-premises infrastructure. Here's how you can distribute these automation efforts:

1. **Azure Automation**: 
   
   - Infrastructure Deployment: Use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform to automate the deployment of Azure resources.
   
   - Configuration Management: Implement Azure Automation State Configuration to manage the configuration of Azure VMs.
   
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Utilize Azure DevOps pipelines or GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment processes targeting Azure resources.
   
   - Monitoring and Alerting Automation: Leverage Azure Monitor for automated monitoring and alerting configurations within your Azure environment.
   - Backup and Disaster Recovery Automation: Set up automated backup and disaster recovery solutions using Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery.

2. **On-Premises Automation**:
   - Infrastructure Deployment: Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code software tool created by HashiCorp. Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language, or optionally JSON. 

   [Install Terraform on an on-premises machine and configure Terraform](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/cloud-firewall/developer-reference/install-terraform-on-an-on-premises-machine-and-configure-terraform)
    
   - Configuration Management: Use configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate the setup and configuration of on-premises servers and networking equipment. Apply automation scripts to configure software, services, and system settings on your on-premises servers.

   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI to automate the deployment of applications and configurations to on-premises servers.

   [Install Jenkins on Windows](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/jenkins-tutorial/jenkins-installation-on-windows)
   
   - Monitoring and Alerting Automation: Deploy monitoring solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack on-premises, and automate their configuration and alerting processes.

   [install Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)   
   
   - Backup and Disaster Recovery Automation: Utilize backup and disaster recovery solutions compatible with your on-premises environment, and automate backup schedules, retention policies, and failover processes.


One can achieve end-to-end automation of your hybrid system setup, ensuring consistency, reliability, and efficiency across all components.
